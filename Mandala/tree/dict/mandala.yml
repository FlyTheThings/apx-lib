  - name: sns
    title: Sensors
    desc: Read only data sources, measured by sensors from physical parameters.
      Used as inputs to estimators. Never sent through telemetry stream.

      - name: nav
        content: sns-nav
        title: Navigation
        desc: Sensors used for vehicle navigation and controls.
          Used as input for position and attitude estimators and
          for filters to supply aerodynamic controls.

      - name: env
        content: sns-env
        title: Environment
        desc: Environmental sensors.
          Data used as inputs for filters to estimate vehicle state
          and safety conditions.

  - name: ctr
    title: Controls
    desc: Controls for vehicle drives and servos.
      Published by regulators.
    content:

        # content: ctr-nav
        title: Navigation
        desc: Controls used for vehicle stabilization.
          Data published by controllers for aerodynamic controls.

      - name: env
        # content: ctr-env
        title: Environment
        desc: Environmental controls.
          Data generated by internal logic or uplink from GCS.

  - name: state
    title: State
    desc: Current vehicle state.
      Estimated values of sensors and current navigator status.
    content:
      - name: nav

      - name: env
        # content: state-env
        title: Environment
        desc: Processed data of current vehicle conditions.
          Can be overriden by GCS uplink.

  - name: cmd
    title: Commands
    desc: Commanded values.
      Received from the GCS or provided by navigator as commands for
      regulators.
    content:
